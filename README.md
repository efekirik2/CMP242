CMP242: OBJECT-ORİENTED PROGRAMMİNG2-ZOO SIMULATOR

The goal of this project is to simulate the daily operations of a zoo — managing animals, their behaviors, feeding routines, and sounds — using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python.
It will demonstrate how classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation work together in a real-world scenario.


⦁	Class & Objects – each animal is an object of a class.

⦁	Inheritance – common animal properties are inherited by specific animal types.

⦁	Polymorphism – each animal overrides methods like make_noise() and feed().

⦁	Encapsulation – managing animal data safely within the Zoo class.


Animal-Base Class

Attributes: name, age, round

Methods:

make_noise() – default sound

feed() – default feeding behavior

show_info() – displays info
